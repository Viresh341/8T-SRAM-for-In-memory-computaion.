# 8T-SRAM-for-In-memory-computaion.
This repository presents the group project titled “A Fast Half Adder using an 8T SRAM for Computation in Memory”, which explores a novel design methodology to implement logic-in-memory using 8-transistor (8T) SRAM cells. By leveraging in-memory computation, the project addresses the Von Neumann bottleneck and reduces energy-intensive data transfers between processor and memory. The design integrates a half adder circuit with custom-modeled logic gates and SRAM-based memory cells, controlled through a 2:1 MUX to facilitate seamless read and write operations. Simulations were conducted using Tanner EDA tools to validate performance in terms of power, delay, and stability. This work has broad applications in AI/ML accelerators, embedded systems, and energy-efficient processors[Digital___VLSI.pptx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21524219/Digital___VLSI.pptx)
